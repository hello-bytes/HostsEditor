HostsEditor
===========

As a windows developer, we will change the hosts file for local test ,however, It is difficult to modify this file(we should find the file from C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and open it(no dot, in os after vista, uac is a problem too.))

this editor is to solve this problem. this tool will read and display the hosts file. when you click the save button,it will write the hosts file.
